# Routing-Protocols

In this project, I have used NS-3 Simulator. The code is made for running the simulationa dn providing 4 different types of outputs:
1. A * .routes* file, having routing table for each nodes.
2. A *.csv* file, having a summary of successful transmitted packets.
3. A *.tr* file, having all transmissions and receptions on the network.
4. Multiple *.pcap* files containing traffic through different nodes.

Also, I have calculated **Transmission Range**, **Delay** and Switched between different routing protocols, including DSR, AODV and DSDV.
